Abby, pretending to be a wannabe actress and hanger-on of Cassano's, is fed a drug in the form of a Japanese-style hard candy called Sakura Magic and feigns a drug-induced trance in order to convince Cassano to buy it from Laurent. Edamura then realizes that being brought to help with this con was Laurent's scheme the whole time, and that both Kudou and the woman he conned earlier were in on it. Not pleased with the way Laurent has been using him, Edamura tries to run away, but is captured due to the tracking device that Laurent secretly placed on him.

Struggling to find work due to his father's criminal past, he got a job as a salesman for Kudou's company to support his ailing mother Miki Edamura, only to find that the company has been engaging in consumer fraud without his knowledge. The police did not believe he didn't know about the scam, and Edamura was sent to prison. After being released on parole, Edamura's criminal record prevented him from getting a new job, and his mother passed away. With no other way to making a living, Edamura approaches Kudou offering to partner with him and become Japan's greatest con man. In the present, after Laurent and Abigail cut Edamura down from the Hollywood sign, Laurent explains his intention to scout him with help of an associate and that Sakura Magic is fake and he is using its rumored existence to scam Cassano. That night, Laurent meets with Cassano and makes a deal to sell a huge batch of Sakura Magic to him.

The next morning, he was prepared to return to Japan, but at the airport he was captured by Salazar, a former gang boss now in Cassano's employ. With Edamura forced to stay until the deal is complete, he decided to pretend that he created Sakura Magic, offering to sell Cassano a fake formula for the drug for a much higher price. After Laurent and Abby arrive, Cassano asks for proof of Edamura's credentials, which they fake by having Kudou's company act as doctors at the pharmaceutical research center where Laurent claimed that Edamura worked. That night, Cassano discusses an alternative location for the deal knowing that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/LAPD" title="LAPD">LAPD</a> detective Anderson has been hot on his trail. On the way there, a <a href="/wiki/Car_chase" title="Car chase">car chase</a> between Cassano's car, driven by Salazar, and Anderson ensues, but they manage to shake Anderson off. Cassano reveals that he is bribing Anderson, and the chase was staged to keep the LAPD from becoming suspicious. Everybody arrives at the trade location, an abandoned cider brewery now used to prepare drugs. Cassano orders Edamura to make Sakura Magic himself, and when Edamura claims that conditions are not ideal for making the drug, Cassano offers to renovate it. Cassano sends Edamura to stay at Salazar's house until the new lab is complete, separating him from Laurent and Abby.

With Edamura under Salazar's watch at all times and a week remaining until the lab is ready, Abby sneaks in at night so Edamura can take lessons from Laurent and a drug cook via videoconferencing and construct a plausible fake version of Sakura Magic to fool Cassano. The next day Edamura goes sightseeing with Salazar, visiting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grauman%27s_Chinese_Theater" title="Grauman's Chinese Theater">Grauman's Chinese Theater</a> and attending a baseball game at <a href="/wiki/Dodger_Stadium" title="Dodger Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a>, and finds out that Salazar has a son named Tom, living in foster care after the death of Salazar's wife, who he is missing a visit with because of Cassano's command that he entertain Edamura. At Edamura's behest, they pick Tom up and take him to a theme park so he can spend the day with his father. While using the restroom, Edamura is approached by Paula and Anderson. Paula tells him that she is well aware of the scheme and coerces him into acting as a mole to aid an FBI sting operation to arrest Laurent and Cassano, in exchange for which they will clear Edamura of wrongdoing and return him to Japan. Edamura discovers a hidden camera in his bedroom at Salazar's home, meaning his contact with Abby and Laurent has been found out. The next day, everybody convenes at Cassano's mansion for a party, unaware that there is a traitor among them, but to Edamura's relief, Cassano accuses his financial manager. Edamura confronts Salazar about the camera and asks him why he didn't expose him to Cassano, and Salazar explains that he became a gang lord and later Cassano's bodyguard out of a desire to rise above his poor upbringing and give his son a better life. This reminds Edamura of his own father's arrest on suspicion of aiding a <a href="/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a> ring, prompting him to agree to cooperate with Paula and the FBI on the condition that they let Salazar go free. </td> </tr> <tr class="vevent" style="text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2"> <th id="ep5" rowspan="1" scope="row" style="text-align:center">5</th> <td class="summary" style="text-align:left">"CASE1_5: Los Angeles Connection"</td> <td style="text-align:center">Yoshiyuki Shirahata<br/>Yukiko Imai</td> <td style="text-align:center">June 2, 2020<span style="display:none"> (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2020-06-02</span>)</span> <span style="font-size:85%;">(Netflix Japan)</span><br/>August 5, 2020<span style="display:none"> (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2020-08-05</span>)</span> <span style="font-size:85%;">(+Ultra)</span></td> </tr> <tr class="expand-child"> <td class="description" colspan="5" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #CCCCFF"> With the laboratory ready, Edamura goes through the motions of making Sakura Magic while wearing the glasses with the FBI bug, despite Paula's earlier refusal to absolve Salazar of blame.

Abby steals a gun and aims at an officer and is shot down, along with Laurent when he tries to protect her. Distraught, Edamura attacks Paula and holds her at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her if the FBI and LAPD don't open a path out for him and Salazar. In the confusion, Cassano blows up the lab. Cassano attempts to escape, but Edamura chases after him, and Cassano viciously beats him before Salazar arrives and saves Edamura by punching him out. The three are taken to the FBI's surveillance trailer, but rather than arrest Cassano, Paula agrees to free him and destroy evidence of his involvement for a bribe of $100 million. Edamura is furious, but is knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant. Edamura awakens later on an island, where Laurent and Abby greet him and Paula reveals her true identity as Cynthia Moore, part of Laurent's gang. At Cynthia's villa, where Laurent's gang are celebrating the success of their scam and Cassano's downfall, Laurent explains that everything was staged; the FBI officers were all part of his crew and their weapons were just props. He and Abby faked their deaths to convince the LAPD to overlook them and focus only on Cassano. He also tells Edamura that Salazar has given up on being a gangster to focus on being a father, aided by a reward from the FBI he obtained for turning Cassano in. After the party, Edamura returns to Japan to turn himself in and use his share of the profits to compensate the victims he helped Kudou scam.

He threatens Ozaki with the sword, but Ozaki takes it and slashes Edamura, prompting Laurent's gang to start firing. Fearing for their lives, Akemi, Ishigami, Liu, and Chen evacuate the office with their assistants. When the gunfire stops, they return to the office to find it abandoned. Akemi sees a lever and pulls it, causing the office to lower to the ground floor where they find out that they were actually in a fake building on a remote island. As they walk away, the replica building collapses. </td> </tr> <tr class="vevent" style="text-align:center;background:#F2F2F2"> <th id="ep23" rowspan="1" scope="row" style="text-align:center">23</th> <td class="summary" style="text-align:left">"CASE4_9: Wizard of Far East"</td> <td style="text-align:center">Hiro Kaburaki</td> <td style="text-align:center">September 21, 2020<span style="display:none"> (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2020-09-21</span>)</span> <span style="font-size:85%;">(Netflix Japan)</span><br/>December 16, 2020<span style="display:none"> (<span class="bday dtstart published updated">2020-12-16</span>)</span> <span style="font-size:85%;">(+Ultra)</span></td> </tr> <tr class="expand-child"> <td class="description" colspan="5" style="border-bottom:solid 3px #CCCCFF"> A few days after the fateful Suzaku Group meeting Akemi, Liu, Chen, and Ishigami adjust to life abandoned on the remote island. On the morning of the transaction, Edamura dreamed of the time he gave his mother a gashapon figure of a wizard and she hoped that it meant that she would meet Ozaki again soon. The details of the Far East operation are explained. Edamura drugged Akemi and Ishigami while Laurent did the same with Liu and Chen, enabling them to be unknowingly flown to the island. Laurent's gang created a replica of the headquarters, while Laurent secretly replaced the poison needle inside Liu's ring with an ordinary one. After the targets evacuated the office, the gang wildly fired their guns as a diversion to make their escape with the check and briefcase. Edamura was wearing a bag of fake blood underneath his blazer which only Laurent noticed. Cassano, Sam, and James are shown to have helped out. The gang parties away, and at sunrise, Laurent throws Dorothy's ring into the sea having avenged her. A few weeks later, Ozaki visits his wife's grave for the first time, while Si-Won advises Kudou to forget about his daughter who is in his ex-wife's custody. Cynthia raises one of the smuggled children, Kawin, and helps him decide on his future, while Abby goes rock climbing at <a href="/wiki/Red_Rock_Canyon_National_Conservation_Area" title="Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area">Red Rock Canyon</a> to take a selfie which she sends to Edamura. Meanwhile, Laurent prepares to con his next target, the newly elected <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>. In the epilogue, Dorothy is revealed to be alive, living with <a href="/wiki/Amnesia" title="Amnesia">amnesia</a> on an island near <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> under the name Xiangxiang. Her caretakers find the ring inside the stomach of a fish they caught, and Dorothy puts it on her finger. </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Notes">Notes</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Great_Pretender_episodes&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Notes">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2> <style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r1011085734"> .mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman} </style> <div class="reflist reflist-lower-alpha"> <div class="mw-references-wrap"> <ol class="references"> <li id="cite_note-9"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><b><a href="#cite_ref-9">^</a></b></span> <span class="reference-text">The episodes were streamed in advance on Netflix in Japan with five episodes every week beginning on June 2, 2020.</span> </li> <li id="cite_note-10"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><b><a href="#cite_ref-10">^</a></b></span> <span class="reference-text">This is a reference to the Mexican artist <a href="/wiki/Gustavo_Montoya" title="Gustavo Montoya">Gustavo Montoya</a> who is best known for his paintings of children and street scenes.</span> </li> </ol> </div> </div> <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="References">References</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Great_Pretender_episodes&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: References">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span> </h2> <link href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1011085734" rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style"/> <div class="reflist"> <div class="mw-references-wrap"> <ol class="references"> <li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><b><a href="#cite_ref-1">^</a></b></span> <span class="reference-text"><style data-mw-deduplicate="TemplateStyles:r1067248974">.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:"\"""\"""'""'"}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#3a3;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}</style><cite class="citation web cs1"><a class="external text" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-04/wit-studio-announces-great-pretender-anime-for-2020/.148641" rel="nofollow">"WIT Studio Announces Great Pretender Anime for 2020"</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Anime_News_Network" title="Anime News Network">Anime News Network</a></i>.
